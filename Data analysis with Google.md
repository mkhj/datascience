### Exploring and Preparing your Data with BigQuery and DataPrep

Notes for https://www.coursera.org/learn/gcp-exploring-preparing-data-bigquery/

1. Create new data set - name it ecommerce

2. Run following query (should import one day worth of data into you the data set from above)
#standardSQL
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ecommerce.all_sessions_raw_dataprep
OPTIONS(
  description="Raw data from analyst team to ingest into Cloud Dataprep"
) AS
SELECT * FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions_raw` 
WHERE date = '20170801'; #limiting to one day of data 56k row for this lab

3. 
Go to DataPrep -> BigQuery -> ecommerce 
You should see the data from the import in there
